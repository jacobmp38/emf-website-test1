                    <p>Electrical Minds Forum (EMF) is the society of the students of the De-partment of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. EMF officially be-gan its operation in 2011. Since then the Electrical Department Students raised the club to what it is now.EMF aims to act as a bridge between the students and the strides made in the industry. EMF, the Electrical Association of Model Engineering College is the joint venture of the staff and students of the Electrical and Electronics Department. Electrical Minds Forum (EMF) of Govt. Model Engineering College is a noble attempt to create a platform on which one can discuss ideas, practice and articulate a shared vision for progress in the areas of interest. EMF will aid thought-provoking interactions and motivate the students to excel. EMF will help in achieving career goals, technological innova- tion, and continuous improvement. Our primary objective is to develop a passion in students for electrical and electronics engineering and help them achieve their goals. As an organization at the campus level, we aspire to create a platform for students to showcase their ideas and skills, assist them in their work, and keep them abreast of all the developments in the field. In addition to enhancing the technical background of students, we also give due importance to developing their organizational and management skills. Our goal is to mold a smarter generation of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. EMF brings together eminent personalities from organizations of high repute such as Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) and enables students to engage in interactions with them. EMF has initiated conducting workshops, interactive seminar sessions, PCB design workshops, and lectures consistently every year in MEC. EMF also takes the initiative in organizing Industrial Visits for students of the electrical and electronics department, such that students get enough in- dustrial exposure along with theirÂ academics.</p>
